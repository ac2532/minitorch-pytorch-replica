# minitorch-pytorch-replica

Minitorch is a simple implementation of PyTorch using Python only. 

On the high level, it is composed of 4 parts:
-  the fundamentals: python operations, higher order functions
-  autodifferatiation: scalars, derivatives, chain rule, backpropagation
-  tensors: indexing, broadcasting, operations using tensors, gradients and auto-gradients
-  networks: 1D and 2D convolution, pooling, softmax, and dropout 

This was implemented as part the machine leanring engineering class at Cornell Tech.
